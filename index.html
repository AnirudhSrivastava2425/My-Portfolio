        I started my journey of coding with Python and JavaScript. I was very
        excited about programming because Python was introduced first time in
        our CBSE curriculam. It was a challenging moment as our teacher was
        working with Python for the first time as well. What I learned from
        school was not only how to code but also how to solve the problem using
        internet. I was introduced to online coding competitions by my friend
        and I was hooked up with it. The joy of solving a problem and finding
        the solution doing something meaningless gives mindblowing satisfation.
        <br /><br />
        After my high school I opt Computer Science Honors for my graduation
        course where I learned programming to its fullest extend. I learned
        different things about programming and other programming languages as
        well. Other than being a developer, I also learn data analysis and data
        mining using python libraries. I also learn GUI programming using
        languages java and C++.
